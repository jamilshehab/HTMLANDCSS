      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>When creating a website, the About Us page is one of the first supporting pages you’ll likely design,<br> regardless of the industry you’re in.
        <br>
        They may go by different labels—“About,”<br> “Story,” <br>“Mission”—but these types of<br> pages generally serve the same key purpose: to be the go-to page for a brand to say, “This is who we are.”
        <br>
        When a visitor wants to <br>learn more about you or your <br>business, the About page is the page they’ll look for.
        <br>
        Unfortunately,<br> About Us pages are often treated as an obligation <br> rather than an opportunity to build trust, tell your story,<br> and share what makes you, you.</p>
